# SurvivalPi

## Overview

SurvivalPi is meant to be a resource that can help people around the globe survive in trying times.
The first goal is to provide a library. Information can be basic such as creating a food stock pile, how to build a fire and how to live off the land.
However, resources that go over more complex tasks such as how to build a generator, repair a car and anything else that might not be intuitive should
also be included.

There needs to be a hardware component to this as well. If you truly need the library of information here, then you probably won't have a steady supply
of power. You also might want something that is small and portable. Details concerning the hardware we attempt to use will be kept here as well.

## Submitting

**Who can submit?** Anyone.
**How to submit:** The current process (which will be improved) is to checkout a branch and add your library to the lib/submitted folder. They will be
merged into master after being authenticated.
**Regulations:** Don't submit copy righted material.
**Authentication:** Functionality will be added that allows articles to be rated as proven/authenticated. Users will be able to grade/vote
on articles that they have tried themselves. If an article gets enough votes they will be moved out of submitted and into the library itself.
If an article is given too many disproven/failure ratings then that article will be removed from the repository.
**keywords:** Searching based on keywords is planned, to make it easier to sort through the large amount of documents that are expected to be here.
If you submit a document please include a keywords section. Place a few words that describe your article such as #food, #tools, #shelter, #electronic, #mechanical etc.
**Format:** Currently articles are accepted in any format. The preferred format is html. A website is in progress with the hopes that it will be easier
for everyone to just enter text there without needing to worry about advanced formatting.

## Legal Side
