# SurvivalPi

## Overview

SurvivalPi is meant to be a resource that can help people around the globe survive in trying times.
The first goal is to provide a library. Information can be basic such as creating a food stock pile, how to build a fire and how to live off the land.
However, resources that go over more complex tasks such as how to build a generator, repair a car and anything else that might not be intuitive should
also be included.

There needs to be a hardware component to this as well. If you truly need the library of information here, then you probably won't have a steady supply
of power. You also might want something that is small and portable. Details concerning the hardware we attempt to use will be kept here as well.
