<h1>Ground Rules</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Create a stock pile of items that you actually want to eat.</li>
	<li>Create a budget that you adhere to, and make buying stockpile items part of your weekly shopping routine.</li>
	<li>Cycle old items out of your stockpile once a month by eating them. This will keep your stockpile fresh.</li>
	<li>Aim to have enough supplies to last you at least 2 months</li>
	<li>Keep your stock pile separate from the rest of your food.</li>
	<li>Don't over do it. Once you hit that 2 month supply, don't waste money on extra supplies.</li>
</ol>
